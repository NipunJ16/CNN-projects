This is a deep learning based project which works on classifying human emotions and gender in real time. The human emotions are classified into 7 different categories namely angry, disgust, fear, happy,  neutral, sad and surprise. The model using the OpenCV library for detect the human face in real time and for the classification purpose i build a neural network consisting of 4 convolutional layers and pooling layers for the purpose of feature extraction, followed by few dense neural network layers to classify the image. The model was trained on FER-2013 dataset, and it produces an accuracy of 73% during the training phase.
